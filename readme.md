This application enable us to create post and show,edit,delete on each post.  
And in addition to these function, you can write additional note writings on each post like pasting Post-it ;in fact I designed this note writing layout imaging Post-it.

Your post have imformation of year, month, day,and time that post was created, so you can look back easily if it passed few days from the day you created the post.  

The layout of application is monotone and simple, because I wanted to create cool design.  
But I think it is not good the design of application is too simple, so I designed column of note writing collapsible.  
By using this collapsible design, content of note writing become good to view and dynamic motion makes users interesting.  


User admin function is created, so it is nessesary to confirm to see your diary. 

You can use this application safely.


# install  
If you use this application on your local environment, you have to prepare WEBserver and DBserver.  
I use XAMPP package for constructing these server, so put this application project on htdocs in XAMPP folder.  

And you have to set .env file to match for your environment.
